>> You can change the timestep according to what you want to use in LANDIS-II.
>> WARNING : The timestep you use should be the same as the one used for Biomass Succession,

>> Here, input the the location of the temporary file that will be created by
>> MHS-CBAU_MainScript.py and then used by Magic Harvest to re-load the parameters of Biomass Succession.
>> This temporary file will be based on the content of biomassHarvestParameterFileTemplate.txt,
>> but will be dynamically edited by MHS-CBAU_MainScript.py to control what Biomass Harvest will do.
>> I recommand that you name this file biomassHarvestParameterFilePrepared.txt, and that you locate
>> it in the same folder as biomassHarvestParameterFileTemplate.txt to keep things simple. But the choice
>> is yours; it should not have any impact on your simulation.
>> KEEP IN MIND : The path should be relative to the location of the main scenario file
>> for your simulation.
