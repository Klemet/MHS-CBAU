>> BIOMASS HARVEST PARAMETER FILE
>> This file is the template for the main parameter file given to Biomass Harvest.
>> It is modified dynamically during simulations with the MHS-CBAU approach
>> by the Python script called by Magic Harvest (MHS-CBAU_MainScript.py).
>> These dynamic edits allow us to control what Biomass Harvest does completly.
>> See https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest/ for more details.

>> WARNING : In order to make this file independant of the rest of your
>> simulation as possible, the original file contains "dummy" instructions that
>> will be replaced by the real instructions when Magic Harvest will run, 
>> copy the template, and edit it before reloading the parameters of Biomass Harvest
>> with the edited version.

>> WARNING Some keywords here (e.g. for planting) are not used with Biomass Succession, and
>> are used/from Magic Harvest. They are put in comments so as to not be read by Biomass Harvest.
>> Don't remove the comment symbols at the beginning of the lines !

>> WARNING : No stand qualifications are indicated to biomass harvest here.
>> That means that you have to filter what stands should not be available for
>> harvesting through the python script (MHS-CBAU_MainScript.py), as no filtering
>> will be done here (for example, excluding stands that are too young).

>> WARNING : All of the prescriptions in probabilityMatrixCutsVersusStandType.csv
>> and cutSizesDistribution.json should be accounted for here. Other prescriptions
>> not present in this files can be defined here for other purposes (for example,
>> a second pass for the shelterwood or seed tree).
