## What is MHS-CBAU ?

MHS-CBAU is a an approach to simulate a Business-As-Usual forest management in Canadian lanscapes that are simulated with the [LANDIS-II](https://www.landis-ii.org/) model and its [Magic Harvest](https://github.com/Klemet/LANDIS-II-Magic-Harvest) extension.

MHS-CBAU works through a specific Python script (available in this repository) that is called by Magic Harvest during a LANDIS-II simulation. The Python script will make all forest management decisions, and then pass them to the [Biomass Harvest](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Biomass-Harvest/) extension of LANDIS-II which will execute the harvesting. To learn more about this method of using Magic Harvest and Biomass Harvest in tandem, please see [this workshop](https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest/).

To make the management decisions in the Canadian landscape where the situation is made, the Python script of MHS-CBAU needs several inputs; some are generated by LANDIS-II during the simulation, but some need to be created before the simulation. This repository contains all of the instructions and scripts to create these inputs for your study area, wherever it is in Canada.

The repository also contains a complete documentation in a web format and powerpoint format. 

## How to use this repository ?

I recommand you do the following :

- Take a look at the [Magic Harvest Workshop](https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest/) if you haven't already (important to understand how Magic Harvest works, which is essential to use MHS-CBAU). **Estimated time of reading : 2-4 hours**
- Take a look at the [MHS-CBAU workshop]() (*coming soon*) (important to understand the inputs of MHS-CBAU and its algorithm). **Estimated time of reading : 2-4 hours**
- Use the scripts in this repository to generate the inputs for your own study area, using the [MHS-CBAU workshop]() (*coming soon*) as a guide.
- (Optional but recommanded) use a Python interactive terminal (I recommand to use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)) to test the MHS-CBAU Python script outside of a LANDIS-II simulation to see if it works properly, and produces outputs that make sense for your study area. To do this, simply run a LANDIS-II simulation without MHS-CBAU activated (doing it for a single timestep is enough). Then, use the outputs of LANDIS-II and the debug mode of the MHS-CBAU Python script to test the script as if it was running during the timestep of LANDIS-II for which you have generated outputs.
- Insert the scripts and pre-generated intputs for MHS-CBAU in your LANDIS-II simulation files to start using MHS-CBAU during your simulations.
